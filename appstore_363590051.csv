Zackster2097,2021-08-11 14:20:37-07:00,1,0,After the update ….,"Last night I was watching greys anatomy like every night, but then this morning Netflix whole interface changed and now I can’t find anything. Not even my watch list is correct. Plus you have to scroll down past things to watch to find your watch list. Not a good thing for me. Netflix is going to lose my sub if I can’t watch greys."
Pretty_Softie,2021-08-11 13:24:47-07:00,5,0,ABSOLUTELY LOVE,"First off, I love Netflix. It has All the Shows I want and it has so many cool features to make it even better!

This happens on the app while the website says there are no seasons."
Raygar49,2021-08-10 22:37:06-07:00,3,0,COULD BE BETTER,I believe that Netflix is good but they charge $15 dollars for their services yet an anime app that I know has included a way to put comments and opinions on the anime show they watch weather it’s good or bad and give it a rating or even say cool didn’t like and could comment to other people’s comments I feel like Netflix added something like that they could get opinions from people to see what they would like to watch and also I love the fact that the have good anime only reason I still have them would like to see more and hopefully they keep it up so far I’ve loved all anime.
nyxaz,2021-08-10 22:26:10-07:00,2,0,Concern with iOS app,For some reason the series/movies I watched on TV is not showing on my iPad Pro(when you want to continue watching). Software and Netflix app are up to date.

_L_P_,2021-08-10 03:37:58-07:00,1,0,Terrible,"Can’t do the most basic function: look up and play a movie in the database. Instead, you type in a search term, it utterly fails to bring up the movie with that title and instead bombards you with “suggestions” and “trending”, most of which is crap, unrelated to the search term, and - as far as I can tell - showing little relevance to user interests or history.

Just let me look up and play the movie I want. Why make that impossible?!!"

This has been going on for several days now. What’s the point in installing the app if I can’t even use it?
NOTursunshine,2021-08-09 20:16:48-07:00,3,0,Support help,I was having problems. My account was hacked. I called to report the problem. Two people could not help me because they had to follow the steps. Even the manager said we have to start with step one and proceed down the list. I canceled my subscription.
Newton42,2021-08-09 20:14:13-07:00,1,0,No airplay support,"Seeing that Netflix app is no longer supporting airplay, I’m voicing my disappointment here. Maybe the Disney app will support airplay when it comes out.

Also, the amount of A B testing inside the app is obnoxious."

Kaitlin047652,2021-08-08 23:56:35-07:00,2,0,what in the world,All my shows in my continue watching have disappeared. Along with that all the shows that were in my list disappeared. I have looked them up on safari as ex “grey’s anatomy netflix” which will then show me to the page I cannot access by searching in app. And when it does take me to the page it will not let me watch it. There’s not a button to press on the page at all.  And no the app is not messed up entirely I can watch new shows that show up in the continue watching at least. I have no clue what the problem is as my phone and app are completely up to date i have 4 bars of service & wifi. Very upset if it is the new update that caused this to happen as it’s happened to others.
fix. your site. please,2021-08-08 23:05:53-07:00,1,0,Please fix!!!!!!!!!,"What’s happening with the app, I can’t watch anything right now and it’s been happening for days. Please fix it!!!"
hasilly,2021-08-08 22:30:58-07:00,4,0,Suggestion: Let me see my liked shows,"Obviously I love Netflix. I thank all the developers for their hard work! I have one suggestion though. I would love to be able to see the shows I liked (and potentially the ones I dislike as well). For context, right now I have all the shows I love in my list as well as shows I plan on watching in the future in my list. So basically my list is a mess. 🙃 I like to keep the shows I like in my list so I can rewatch them or so I can scroll through when people ask for a Netflix recommendation. Being able to separate the two into two separate lists would be life changing. Thank you!! 💗"
Food 🍲,2021-08-08 22:16:24-07:00,1,0,It won't let me do anything,It won't let me sign in or make an account whenever I keep trying to make one or sign in it keeps loading back to the red sign in button and I really want to watch Netflix an not have a problem so please can you fix it please and thank you ❤

Please allow folks to turn off this auto crap. Please."
istg.,2021-08-08 20:34:32-07:00,1,0,😐,this thing be glitching sometime and be acting up. also you guys continue to put shows on Netflix and take the good ones out. and that’s what i don’t get about you guys not all the shows you put that are new are top notch you guys still haven’t put out the good ones like frozen but i-Carly and sam and cat?! but no frozen i don’t get it you guys be taking out my favorite movies and shoes like cmon now not cool 💀😐.
#ilovefoxes,2021-08-08 19:53:30-07:00,4,0,What?,I was recently re-logging into Netflix and it literally won’t let me login it just keeps going out of the app so I don’t know what to think.
V7008,2021-08-08 19:32:51-07:00,1,0,Have a friend who pirates movies,Make sure you have a friend who pirates movies with a VPN using bit torrents. You download a fraction of a film at a time. It’s still legal in my area. Yay! You won’t have to pay streaming bills up the butt. If we do this (use Pirate Bay.com) these companies will start charging less and stop molesting us. Do it people. But make sure your “friend” is the one doing it just you be safe. Enjoy and arrrrgggh! Friends pirate for friends!
.....nickname...,2021-08-08 17:39:17-07:00,1,0,230 billion $ company with a 2$ app…,Why is it 2021 and you still can’t cast properly to your tv? I get better streaming performance from The Chosen app. A christian streaming platform funded by a couple thousand people. It’s kinda sad tbh…
Bri<3!!!,2021-08-08 17:20:46-07:00,3,0,Good app but…,don’t like how they take out all of the good movies and shows. Many of my comfort shows have been taken out and I have no where else to watch it. It is understandable that every show has its time to leave but many have been taken down not long after being put out. The worst part is cancelling enjoyable shows/movies to renew a season or make a part two of something people can go their life without. Maybe it’s a coincidence that a lot of the shows that have been cancelled are shows with representation for all communities but i’m going to take it to offense.
I love flowers 🌸,2021-08-08 17:16:45-07:00,5,0,I love this app,It has my favorite shows and it has interactives witch I love but also get Hulu
mynicknameisloser,2021-08-08 15:39:34-07:00,2,1,Greedy.,Been using Netflix for years but I have a major issue with the fact that I need to pay extra to gain access to 4K content. There is no reason I should have to upgrade my subscription and pay more  after I just spent hundreds on a brand new 4K tv.

Quicksilver691,2021-08-08 12:32:44-07:00,1,0,Improve UI to match androids,"Is it so difficult to make the improvements below? 

Common Netflix….

Please give the option to set the following: Simple things that makes android Netflix UI better. 1) Set default language (it keeps automatically resetting to English with audio description on iPhone and iPad after each episode) 2) Set AUTOPLAY next episode when watching on cellular, it’s available on android and it does it on iPhone when on WiFi, can we get the same on cellular?"
!!!!!meep!!!!!,2021-08-08 09:27:34-07:00,5,0,Awesome,First of all I love Netflix I get to watch so many good shows it’s the best but there a few things I would like first it should be an option to only download 1 episode or the entire session and maybe add more of the spy kids movies that’s all this app is grate

mas5949,2021-08-07 23:36:37-07:00,3,0,A lot of errors lately,"I have been doing a lot of downloading lately since I don’t have WiFi access everywhere and do not want to eat up all of my high speed data. I’ve noticed some content, recently episodes of Arrow, will stream fine while in WiFi but will not play when downloaded. They usually give a 2204 error which doesn’t make sense since I didn’t change regions. When I try to view the episode in the app it either has some weird null coding as the description or won’t show up at all."

Double thumbs upp,2021-08-06 15:14:27-07:00,4,0,app is good.,"Netflix is a great app. i would defeat recommend to other people. but, i do have two problems with the app. my first problem is that netflix adds shows to make people excited, for example, friends. and movies as well, such as goosebumps. they take them off constantly! friends isnt on there anymore, i was in the middle of rewatching. my second issue with netflix is , some shows dont show up on certain devices. lately, riverdale hasnt been showing up on my phone nor ipad. it shows up on my tv though. and both devices are up to date. if theres a way to fix this, please do. overall netflix is a great app. theres a great variety of shows. the only selection that was meh for me was horror. theres not much for horror. but other than that theres great dramas and great reality tv. 4/5 would recommend!"

asdfninethousand,2021-08-06 13:28:55-07:00,4,0,"Very Good, PiP Could Use Work","I love the app, especially smart downloads, but there are a few issues with picture in picture, in particular. I would like to use the app while watching (download management & stuff like that). That currently isn’t supported. Hulu’s player has a PiP button for this. Also this PiP window seems to always be 16:9 for some reason, causing it to take up extra space with the letterboxing."

hannahthehero🦋🦄,2021-08-06 13:04:41-07:00,2,0,Ehhhhhhh,"Now as you see love the app I have been using it for longer than I can remember. But I rated only 2 stars, let me explain..... So, the only problem I see is why they are always removing like the best shows. Like liv and Maddie Will be removed April 22 from Netflix! It’s like everybody’s favorite show including mine! If you will remove stuff at least don’t remove Liv and Maddie! Please!!!! One tiny suggestion please add the show Jessie back on Netflix they removed it a while ago but that show is like the best! Please take my suggestion if you see this Netflix creators or whoever runs Netflix. Again I’m 11 years old so I don’t know much..... Thanks byeeeee. April, 7, 2021. :) Signed, A fan! @-@ Wait I forgot something some stuff in kid section aren’t for kids please fix it some stuff inappropriate what’s with people these days playing nasty rap hood music in car now this!!!....... Wow. Edit few months later: hi I started watching promised never land and I want to know if they have a second season coming out. I watched a video saying season 2 won’t come out for a few years. If there is one. Especially on Netflix. Because whoever is reading this and is a fan of promised never land I will tell you almost every good show comes out way later on Netflix then on other apps. So if the developers or company is reading this then put the new season on now! If there is one! Like it can’t be that hard. Oh and also some stuff in the kids stuff aren’t for kids also why do they have kids kissing it ridiculous and not good and it shouldn’t become a habit in kid shows like come on! Like TV- PG stuff isn’t for kids that’s like teens or older so maybe put that in the adult stuff! But again the worst problem I have already stated in this review is that you only have the first season of the promised never land so put the second season on please!!! Sorry if it sounded harsh but you know I really like the show and I’m not about to wait for two years for like the second season containing only 11 episodes so don’t ruin it!"

trivia poop,2021-08-06 08:10:16-07:00,5,0,Omg so good,"If u haven’t downloaded it yet, WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR!!!
It is the best app to watch shows and movies on. It only lags when ur internet is bad. So if it lags, fix ur internet!! I’m constantly watching series, and movies everyday! Sometimes it even tells u what new movies r coming out soon. If you don’t have a phone like me then that’s ok! It won’t let u see what’s coming out soon but it’s still the exact same thing! So if ur still reading this and u haven’t downloaded it yet, I have no idea what’s wrong with you. DOWNLOAD IT!!!👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻"

DeutschPuzzler,2021-08-05 21:53:45-07:00,1,0,Poor selection,"Some subjects have VERY limited options, especially for documentaries or educational/informative shows. As an example, I tried to look up educational series on dinosaurs or prehistoric life, but all I got were children’s cartoons/fictional material and three documentary series about MODERN animal life - all of which were Netflix produced. It’s nice that Netflix has kid friendly content, but works of pure fiction or antiquated information shouldn’t be the only options I have for certain topics. Not to mention they have done away with so much GOOD content to make way for with their own series. Seriously considering canceling my subscription."
błuėpøtåto,2021-08-05 20:18:38-07:00,5,0,dont listen to what other people say.,"This is a amazing app, it has a lot of animes, horror, romance, ect. Even a kids lock to keep adult shows off the profile. 10/10 i havent had any bugs/problems with this app so far and i have had it for atleast 2-3 years. For example if you wanna play a game and watch netflix at the same time, fear not! if you leave netflix and wanna join maybe a video game, roblox, mnecraft ect you can. it goes into a box into your corner. youcan adjust sizes from small to big with just a drag of an finger. I’m watching netflix while writing this right now actually! 😂 watch it while traveling, commute, or just to take a break."

Tiger.02,2021-08-05 19:39:30-07:00,2,0,Netflix App,"I’ve had several problems with the app lately. It has me sign in every single time I go to open the app, and even if I’ve got all bars of service, it’ll kick me out randomly and make me sign in again or I’ll hit the sign in button after entering my log in and it’ll load like it’s about to work but then go right back to the sign in page and ask me to re enter my log in all over again. Once I’m finally logged in, I will try to click on the show I want to watch and it’ll give me an error and won’t load it or let me watch it. It does this several times and I’ll have to exit out of the app and re sign in before it’ll let me watch the show. Or in the middle of the show, it’ll also just randomly kick me back out to the sign in page. I have had all bars of service, and tried using wifi as well and it still does it. It’s been an issue since it started making me sign in every time I open the app. I think for about the last month? At least the last few weeks. It used to just let me stay signed in and I wouldn’t have to log in every time I opened the app, I also wasn’t having the other issues then either. but since they changed that, I’ve had so many issues with it."

DIFTE AATJ,2021-08-05 15:45:37-07:00,3,0,App Keeps Logging User Out,The phone-based app was stable for many years but within the past few months I’ve been having login issues. It started by not preserving my login details between each session which was annoying but manageable. It has now escalated to logging me out in the middle of a show or shutting down the player window and requiring me to click another tab before selecting the Home tab again and resuming the stream. Today it happened three times in a single 45 min show. Not sure what sort of tweaks are being made but the iPhone app is becoming very unstable.

GeoRitt,2021-08-05 14:37:08-07:00,1,0,Bring back the comments,Somehow Netflix quietly removed the comments section for movies and shows sometime ago. Netflix used our subscription money to pay off politicians and make unnecessary documentaries like knock down the house (the squad) using our subscription dollars. Netflix needs to stop disappointing it’s subscribers while there are other entertainment options out there.

raj1ina B,2021-08-01 10:34:27-07:00,4,0,Greta but hear are some of my thoughts :),"Netflix is so amazing in almost every way! From the acting to the categories! But here are some of my thoughts :)

1. The shows and movies are great! But there are shows totally unheard of and boring! Could u add shows like classics! Like: mean girls, Harry Potter, modern familly… somethign that parents or friends would suggest. Not weird shows or movie with not amazing acting and concept!

2. Mabye add some more languages! I speack loads of languages, but for example French! A very commun language is barley accessible. There are a couple shows and movie where u can change the audio to French, WICH is extremely annoying because that’s my main language.

3. The kids section mostly only has baby shows. Like for 2-4 year olds. Mabye add some more movies for kids ( not baby’s/toddlers) nothing inappropriate but a 8-10 year old does not want to watch aquanauts.

4- my last suggestion is, to change up the movies and shows a little more often. You guys do from time to time dint get me wrong! But I watched basically all fo Netflix for my age and I waited 2 months for a new show or movie for my age group WICH was very disappointing!

Hope some of these thigns can improve! But over all Netflix is a must have"

There have been MANY price increases throughout the way, despite the recent lack in content beyond belief. Almost on the level of cable TV Robbery. I still paid it despite the complaints  because I have two toddlers. They watch Netflix across multiple devices throughout the house (iPads, TV, etc.). Whatever keeps them quite while we are trying to cook. When the device keeps “erroring” out because of “too many streams” of the same children shows and Netflix tells me I need to disconnect the running devices and log-in and do this and do that while I’m cooking. Are you kidding me. They had the courage to send me a “streaming and internet 101” video like I am a moron who doesn’t know how to turn on a computer.  I’m sick and tired of paying out the wazooky for every single streaming service provider. But that being said. The cost is minimal for every other service who actually provides content and lets my kids watch content without disruptions. Sad to see Netflix go down like this for my simple family, but I did thoroughly enjoy the ride."

It’s frustrating because all that’s left is their crap “Netflix originals”. Not all of them are horrible, but most seem like they’re filler since Netflix lost all its deals. I’m disappointed with the quality of their newer shows, and that the enjoyable shows have (almost) all been removed. 
Most of my friends tell me that they don’t even use Netflix anymore because it’s all going downhill, and I’m starting to really agree... It’s not worth the money anymore if Netflix doesn’t step up soon.

If the quality goes down, so should the prices.
Do better Netflix."

You would have to finish downloading it before you get to know the size of it. I feel like if you fix this, the app is going to be a great app and a great viewer choice"

xfuzz monkeyx,2021-07-26 08:26:06-07:00,1,0,Ruined Remake after Remake,Leave it to Netflix to continue to ruin the adaptions of classic shows. Masters of the Universe has always been about He-Man and his battles with Skeletor. Netflix advertised the show by using He-Man as a ploy to get people to watch and then bait and switch him with Teela. What a sham. Pandering to the feminists movement once again has ruined a show and a character for the sake of “progress.” Leave the classics alone and come up with your own original stuff. Stop ruining things that people love.
Panda song,2021-07-26 00:44:56-07:00,1,0,Not compatible with ROKU Tv,"Dear Netflix, for the past few months I have installed the Netflix app on my ROKU TV and began watching Netflix on my TV. Unfortunately, your program doesn’t run well with ROKU’s service. The problems I am experiencing in the app include slow loading, and lagging with the pause features, rewind and fast forward features. This has made my watching experience unpleasant and I find myself watching shows on Netflix as a last resort when the shows or movies can’t be found anywhere else. I have tried many things in order to solve problem such as, disconnecting and reconnecting my WiFi, and uninstalling and reinstalling the app, none of these Methods have done anything to improve the functionality of the app. Also, this problem isn’t  limited to just me, someone else I know happens to own a ROKU TV and is experiencing the exact same problems. I don’t understand selling to a company that is not compatible with your services and nor do I have any interest in continuing to give you a monthly fee for inadequate and lagging services. I suggest you fix this before you lose about 156 dollars a year from me. I would gladly consider recommending other people to do and same, and supporting rival companies who can provide adequate service for cheaper."

Kelanix,2021-07-23 22:31:13-07:00,2,0,Stop breaking things that work!,"This app is generally pretty great. I love the ability to alter the brightness on my video, and what I especially love is that it will auto play the next episode after the previous one. But something you’ve done in the last couple days has completely broken the latter. After every episode, I get kicked back to the episode selection screen. 

What I also don’t like is whenever I bring up a show, it starts an timer that I have to cancel or an episode or some video auto-starts. Plus, it now takes me multiple taps to get to a particular show, where I used to be able to do it with one. This is not improvement, it’s just annoying."

Most of the time new episodes are added like 6 months (sometimes longer) after the creator released them. By the time they do get added, I have already seen all the spoilers to my favourite shows because everyone else has already seen the new episodes.  And I don’t think I have missed an update because it says I have the latest version. Does anyone else have this problem?"

I can still tap and hold the button to see through the timeline and I get the little picture that changes as I hold it through different parts of the episode, which I’m assuming means it’s still downloaded.

phantom my dude,2021-07-22 19:23:15-07:00,4,0,Netflix issues,The shows and movies are great and I enjoy them but you guys do remove a lot of shows and movies that I also loved. And I’m not sure if I’m the only one who has this problem but whenever I watch a new show it won’t save the episode that I was on. However it’s only when it’s in the continue watching for (My Name) section. Also it doesn’t have the red line whenever I finish a episode and it confuses me if I was on that episode or another. I hope Netflix see this and fix the issue.

But there is a few flaws… 1, so I don’t know if this was an old thing and they fixed it but I was on my grandma’s TV and my little sister was with me so I wanted to put something for kids her age like cocomelon I found a kids profile the name was kids and so was the profile pic to I chose that but I was not happy at all it had things that would be on the adult profile and i don't want other little kids having access to things like Twilight and other adult TV shows and movies but her TV is old so that could be something that was fixed. 2 can you please stop removing so many shows? I wanted to check some things out that I watched a long time ago but they where removed! For example I wanted to watch something I had never finished it was the Loili Rock series I looked for it but it was removed and Netflix is the only place I could find it! Worst part none of these things returned! -Thank you if there’s anything else I notice that could be fixed I will inform you! Thank you for taking your time to read this review!

Also I liked old Netflix more when barely anything was money. Oh and you don't even read the comets. not even the good ones so it just shows that all you care about is money and it's rude. I just wanna watch my shows but my little bro is watching pj masks and my big bro is watching flash. And my mom won't pay 17.99 a month for one single user or what ever for 3 people to watch something. And least make it give you 3 cuz it's a overpriced ripoff for 17.99 for one more user. I think that if your think about getting this think again. Or read some of the comments. Maybe try Disney+ prime or YouTube have a grate day from a 8 year old"
